        <H1>ABOUT RAINYDAYS</H1>
        <H2>Pushing the comfort zone</H2>
        <p>Rainydays was established in 1492.</p>

        <p>While Cristopher Columbus was sailing to what he thought to be India, one of his whiny officers got tired of the constant weather changes the Atlantic had to offer.</p>
          
          <p>He found himself cold, warm, dry, wet and everything at once and sought to find a solution.</p>
          
          <p>Tired of listening to Cristopher, he locked himself up in his cabin and spent the whole journey exploring solutions for the perfect jacket.</p>
          
          <p>He never found this solution and he did not found our company either.</p>
          
          <p>We were established our company just a few years ago with our own technology and patents.</p> 
          <p>were no such things back in 1492, but I got you reading this far, right?</p>
